# Class Roster Project

I created this project as a submission for a school assessment.

In this project, I created a simple C++ program to store student data and do various things with the data. Within the project, there are methods to add, remove,
and print the student data on the command line. In addition, the program can display the invalid emails and average days a student takes within a course.
